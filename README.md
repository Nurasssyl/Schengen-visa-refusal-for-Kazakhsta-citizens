# Schengen visa refusal for Kazakhstan citizens in 2023
![](Schengen_Visa_Refusal_Rates_Map_percent.png)

I have made a Schengen visa waiver card for citizens of Kazakhstan for 2023.

I developed this visualization using the R programming language using the libraries: tidyverse, r natural earth, rnaturalearthdata, cowplot. 

Top 5 countries with the highest bounce rate:

France ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· - 19.5%
Germany ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª - 17.8%
Spain ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ - 16.4%
Italy ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ - 15.2%
Greece ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· - 15.0%

Top 5 countries with the lowest bounce rate:

Malta ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¹ - 9.8%
Iceland ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¸ - 10.0%
Luxembourg ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡º - 10.5%
Slovenia ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡® - 10.6%
Estonia ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡ª - 10.8%

This map shows which countries of the Schengen area may be more or less loyal when considering visa applications. 

Countries with a low rejection rate may be preferable for citizens of Kazakhstan planning trips to Europe. 

However, it is important to remember that the success of applying for a visa depends on meeting all the requirements and preparing the documents correctly.
